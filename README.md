## ✨ Introduction  

🎯 The **goal** of Education Hub is to make learning resources **accessible, organized, and user-friendly** for students preparing for academics and placements.  

🔹 **Why Education Hub?**  
- Students struggle to find organized notes, PYQs, and placement material.  
- Most resources are scattered across multiple platforms.  
- A single platform with all categorized documents saves time and improves learning.  

Education Hub solves this problem by offering **categorized PDFs with open/download support**, a modern **dark/light theme**, and **animations that make learning enjoyable**.
